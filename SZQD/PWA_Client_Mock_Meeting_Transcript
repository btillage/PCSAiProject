Advisor: Hey, great to see you! How’s everything going? Been up to anything fun lately?

Client: Yeah, everything’s good! I just got back from a little weekend getaway with the family—needed a break from all the business stuff. We went up to the mountains for some hiking and unplugged for a bit. It was nice.

Advisor: That sounds amazing! Where’d you go? Are the kids into hiking, or did you have to drag them along?

Client: (Laughs) They actually loved it! We went to a place upstate we’ve been to before, so they knew what to expect. It was great to get everyone outside and away from screens for a while.

Advisor: That’s awesome. It’s always nice to step back and reset, especially with how busy things have been for you. Speaking of which, I know you’ve had a lot going on lately with the new investments and your business. Anything else new I should know about on that front?

Client: Yeah, things are moving along. I’ve invested more into those two startups—the AI healthcare platform and the blockchain fintech company we talked about last time. They’re still in the early stages, so nothing major to report yet, but I feel good about them. Plus, my dividend income’s been pretty strong, so I’ve got some extra cash on hand.

Advisor: That’s great to hear. Sounds like the startups are progressing at a steady pace, which is good. And the extra cash flow from the dividends gives us some flexibility. Are you thinking about putting some of that money to work? Or keeping a chunk liquid for now?

Client: I’d like to keep a portion of it liquid, just in case anything interesting comes up. But I don’t want it all sitting idle. I was thinking of reinvesting some into something a bit more stable—maybe something that complements the higher-risk stuff.

Advisor: I think that’s a smart approach. We could look into some income-generating assets that are more stable—like high-dividend stocks or maybe some bonds. Another option could be real estate, through REITs, which would give you some exposure without the hassle of managing properties yourself. What do you think?

Client: I’ve actually been thinking about real estate. Not directly managing anything, but REITs sound interesting. I want something more passive but still with a decent return. I’d like to hear more about those, and I’m also open to bonds if they’re the right fit.

Advisor: Great! I’ll pull together some options for both REITs and bonds. We’ll focus on ones with strong track records and solid yields. How’s the family doing, by the way? Everyone keeping busy?

Client: They’re good, thanks for asking. My wife’s been getting into gardening lately, and the kids are deep into their sports—non-stop practices and games, it feels like.

Advisor: Wow, that sounds full-on! What sports are they playing?

Client: My daughter’s into soccer, and my son is doing baseball and basketball. It’s a lot, but they’re having fun, so that’s what matters.

Advisor: That’s great. It sounds like you’ve got a busy household, but in a good way. So, back to the financial side of things—you mentioned philanthropy last time. Have you given more thought to setting up something more formal, like a donor-advised fund?

Client: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I want to be more intentional with my giving, and the donor-advised fund sounds like a good way to start. I’m not quite ready for the whole family foundation thing, but the fund feels like a solid first step.

Advisor: I think that’s a great choice. It gives you flexibility with your donations, and you can take your time deciding where to give while getting the tax benefits upfront. Plus, it’s easy to manage. I can help you get that set up whenever you’re ready. Do you have any specific causes in mind?

Client: Yeah, I’ve got a few. I’ve been supporting some education initiatives and health-related charities, and I want to ramp that up. My wife is also passionate about environmental causes, so we’ll probably focus on those areas.

Advisor: That sounds like a great mix. We’ll make sure your donations are structured in a way that aligns with your goals, both personally and financially. And like you said, we can always revisit the idea of a foundation later on if it feels right. How are you feeling about the overall balance in your portfolio now? Do you think the risk level is where you want it?

Client: I think so. The startups are higher risk, but I’m fine with that for now since I’m not relying on them for immediate returns. With the dividends and the more stable investments, I feel like things are balanced pretty well. I just don’t want to be too exposed on one side.

Advisor: I agree—you’ve got a good mix right now. We’ll keep the startups as your growth play, and with the REITs or bonds, we can stabilize things a bit more. Also, have you given any thought to travel? I know you love to travel with the family—any big trips on the horizon?

Client: We’ve been talking about going to Europe next summer. The kids are at a good age for it now, so we’re thinking of doing a big trip—maybe France or Italy.

Advisor: That sounds amazing! Europe with the kids would be such a memorable trip. And who knows, maybe we can time it around some financial planning for tax-efficient withdrawals to fund that trip! (Laughs)

Client: (Laughs) Now that’s thinking ahead! But yeah, we’re excited about it. It’s been a while since we’ve done a big trip like that.

Advisor: Well, whenever you’re ready to plan, we’ll make sure the finances are in line to support it without skipping a beat on your investment strategy. I’ll get those REIT and bond options over to you soon, and we’ll touch base on the donor-advised fund too. Anything else on your mind?

Client: No, I think we’re good for now. Thanks for staying on top of everything as usual!

Advisor: My pleasure. Enjoy the family time, and we’ll talk again soon!
